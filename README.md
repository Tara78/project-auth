# Project Auth API

we created database/API with authentication and paths for authorized users and registeration routh, and we made Frontend form for users login.

## The problem

we started with backend by creating user model for login or registeration. After that we implemented the authenticatUser, and
encryption, to control/validate the user input and then encrypt the password. If it is a user can login and access to the data otherwise user has to register.

Then we created Thought model for access to see all thoughts, as well as the paths for signup and log in.

For Frontend, By using both component local states as well as Redux states we could set up an intuitive signup/login form.

we had an issu for not following the same path name for frontend, and we could not register a new user.

Done!
